Life Oh Life Oh Life Oh Life
DOO DOOT DOOT DOOO
Life Oh Life Oh Life Oh Life
DOO DOOT DOOO

I am afraid of the dark
especially when I am in a park
and there is no one else around

Ooh I get the shivers
I do not want to see a ghost
it is a sight that I fear most
I would rather have a piece of toast
and watch the evening news

I am a superstitious girl
I am the worst in the world
never walk under ladders
I keep a rabbits tail

I will take you up on a dare
anytime anywhere
Name the place I will be there
Bungee jumping I do not care

Life DOO DOOT DOOO
DOO DOOT DOOO

So after all is said and done
I know I am not the only one
Life indeed can be fun if you really want to

Sometimes living out your dreams
aint as easy as it seems
You wanna fly around the world
in a beautiful balloon
